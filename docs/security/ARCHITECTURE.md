  - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
  - Secure refresh token rotation
  - Token blacklisting capability
- **Session Management**:
  - Secure session storage
  - Session timeout controls
  - Concurrent session limits

### 3. Encryption
- **Data at Rest**:
  - AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
  - Encrypted database fields
